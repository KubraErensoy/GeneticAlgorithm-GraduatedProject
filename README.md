#Genetic Algorithm
The genetic algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm that mimics the biological reproduction and natural selection process belonging to the evolutionary algorithm class. In nature, individuals compete for resources such as food, water, and shelter. At the same time, each individual wants to continue its breed. Under these conditions, individuals who provide the best harmony to the environment win the race. In this way, they can continue their lineage. New individuals produced by the individuals who win the race also get their features from their ancestors. Evolutionary algorithms often produce good solutions to a variety of problems because they have no assumptions about which is the best. Genetic algorithms have been used to find solutions to problems such as traveling salesman problems (TSP). All these algorithms are built on a random process, and instead of producing a single solution to problems with limited information, they create a solution set consisting of different solutions. This cluster is named as the population in GA terminology.
#Concepts of Genetic Algorithm
Gene:City parameter (coordinates (x, y) of chromosome)
Chromosome: Creating a route by combining genes
Fitness Function: The function that allows a good route selection for the solved problem in the algorithm
Population: Chromosome set that can be selected to raise the next generation
Crossover: In the combination of chromosomes, offspring are obtained for future generations.
Mutation: exchange between two randomly selected cities (city is represented the gene in our algorithm)
